I created this with the sole purpose of helping myself on my favorite hobby, decomposing numbers into the number 3. 
This works by converting numbers from decimal to Roman and from Roman into pre-defined mathematical expressions using only the digit 3.
To run this code the only things you need are:
-a computer
-the faith in a higher power that explains the fact that this thing works
